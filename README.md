### More on CLIN

Computational Linguistics in the Netherlands (CLIN) is an annual conference about Computational Linguistics organised in Flanders (Belgium) and The Netherlands. On January 26th 2018, the 28th edition of CLIN is organized by the Centre for Language Studies, Radboud University, under the auspices of the Dutch Research School for Information and Knowledge Systems (SIKS).

CLIN is a splendid occasion for the whole Dutch and Belgian computational linguistics community to get together and present their current work, even if in an ongoing state. International researchers often take part in the conference as well. Submissions usually cover a diverse range of computational linguistics topics resulting in a stimulating event where researchers exchange early research results, compare approaches and get a good sense of the direction of computational linguistics in the Netherlands and Belgium as a whole.

The first CLIN conference was held in 1990 in Utrecht. For an impression of the previous CLIN conferences see the CLIN conference pages from previous years:
