### More on PICA 2021

Recent years have seen the rise of conversational agents (CAs) in everyday life: chatbots that use written communications above all, but also spoken digital assistants. Moreover, conversation is becoming a key mode of human-computer interaction. However, despite much recent success in natural language processing and dialogue research, the communication between a human and a system is still in its infancy. In this context, dialogue personalization could be key to narrow part of the gap, making sense of users’ features (e.g., preferences, expertise, communication style, emotions, personality) when engaged in a conversation with a system. Learning user features directly from the dialogue with a CA, in order to adapt its response, is an opportunity to improve the interaction with the user. Conversational recommender systems can exploit the same paradigm to improve the interaction between the user and system and better elicit information about the user. By exploiting personalized dialogue strategies, users’ preferences can be gathered in a very natural and straightforward fashion and this will lead to more effective recommendations.

We are interested in both long-term engaging spoken dialogue systems and text-based chatbots, as well as conversational recommender systems. Papers can be about different approaches to this: (pilot) evaluations, design guidelines, personalization, natural language processing, protection of privacy and (health) data, (cognitive) architectures and frameworks, implementations, context analyses. We are also very interested in studies on the effectiveness of behaviour change support systems and changing health related behaviour (such as quit smoking, lose weight, etc.).

The main goal of the workshop is to stimulate discussion around problems, challenges, possible solutions and research directions regarding the exploitation of NLP and ML techniques to learn user features and use them to personalize the dialogue in the next generation of intelligent conversational agents.
