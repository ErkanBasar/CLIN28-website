AHA enables researchers to obtain character confusion lists and attendant frequency statistics from word lists. The tool serves to obtain derived information for a variety of purposes such as diachronical or dialectical language variance studies, spelling and OCR-error profiling, etc. A major aim of the web application/service provided is to enable researchers to give a succinct quantitative summary of their gold standard data in terms of the commonly accepted Damerau-Levenshtein error categories of insertion, deletion, substitution, transposition and combinations or special variants e.g. regarding capitalization or spacing. Given for instance a corpus-derived list of the words in a diachronical corpus and a contemporary word list, the tool allows for efficiently determining which historical spelling variations are prevalent in the data. AHA is a subservice of the PICCL (Philosophical Integrator of Computational and Corpus Libraries) corpus building workflow currently being developed at CLST and TiCC in a CLARIAH project.",
